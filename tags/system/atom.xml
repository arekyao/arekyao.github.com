<p>Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.<br />
So does System.</p>

<p>Here is just a simple way to find out what’s ‘unhappy’ in your system.</p>

<h2 id="think-as-time-goes">2,Think as time goes</h2>

<p>There are lots of ways to thinking and find something.<br />
Thinking as time goes is an easy one.</p>

<p>However, what we are going to talking, in fact, is thinking as data flows.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Refer to your system, the data will be transferred like this:</p>

<p>UserRequest -&gt; HttpServer -&gt; UIServer -&gt; DataServer -&gt; Database<br />
UserReceiver &lt;- HttpServer &lt;- UIServer &lt;- DataServer &lt;- Database</p>

<h2 id="userrequest--userreceiver">3,UserRequest &amp; UserReceiver</h2>

<p>Those belong to User Client.</p>

<p>User’s Client depends on Environment, where user run his program, like Operating System, like web browser if the program is an webapp, etc.</p>

<p>If you are doing a stress testing on your system, your stress test tools is a factor ,too.</p>

<h2 id="server-machine">4,Server Machine</h2>

<p>Others like httpserver,uiserver, database, etc, are running on your server, your machine.
Server Machine can have four kind of bottleneck.</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU (see top)</li>
  <li>Swap (see free)</li>
  <li>Network (see iftop)</li>
  <li>Disk (see iotop)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where is the bottleneck?” is a good question, so I’ll ask it back to you in different words: 
is the CPU maxed out (see top)? 
Are the disks struggling (iotop)? 
Are you hitting swap (free)? 
Are you filling the network pipe (iftop)?

<p>The posts, which will give the detail on User &amp; Machine, is on the way.</p>
