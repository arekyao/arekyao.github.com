Here are two interesting stories.


As you know, Peking is a great city, well-known,as big building, huge population, especially the PM2.5 .
So we decided to buy an air-cleaner.
After considering the brand, the work model of air-cleaning, our choice is the SHARP.
Amazon is my fav E-Commerce platform, we bought gift cards on taobao, then ordered the type.



When the machine is sent home by the Express delivery man, we decided to use it immediately.
Everything is fine, until a month goes away.

<!-- more -->

Yep, you know, the air cleaner should be cleaned every month.
(Some part can not cleaned and it's disposible)
When I open the machine, I am shocked.

The three layer of the air-filter is wrapped by the plastics.
All of them!!!
Unbelievable!!!


That means we just open it for one month, just the status is open. 
It does not work effectively.
Maybe that's the reason that the water goes very slowly.
(the air-cleaner have a function: air-humidifying)



The another story is about English study.

Every night, when my baby don't wanna go to sleep, I will turn on the radio, choose the CNN channel.
Then both She and I will have a good night very soon.
