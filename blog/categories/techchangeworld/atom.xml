    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="whats-the-practice">What’s the practice</h2>

<p>The Practice is an American TV series, legal drama. </p>

<p>This show won the Emmy in 1998 and 1999 for Best Drama Series.<br />
The Practice focused on the law firm of Robert Donnell and Associates (later becoming Donnell, Young, Dole, &amp; Frutt, and ultimately Young, Frutt, &amp; Berluti).   </p>

<p>Every story per ep, is made up one or two cases, including both criminal and civil cases, which often mirror current events.Conflict between legal ethics and personal morality was a recurring theme.   </p>

<p>Robert Donnell is the boss, which is tall, handsome, rich, whose gf, linsay Dole and Helen Gamble.<br />
Eugene Young is my favourite lawyer actor, black, strong in debating. <br />
Rebecca Washington, assist of the law firm.<br />
Jimmy Berluti, some poooor guy, fired by last firm for doing something awful and cheating to help bobby donnell.<br />
Ellenor Frutt, fat woman, with a sharp teeth.  </p>

<p>Bobby is an idealist, a lawyer and wanna help the innocent men out.  However, he soon learns that drug dealers and other undeniably guilty clients tend to be the ones who provide the business that keep the firm running.
After realize that, Bobby change his idea that defending for the innocent to defending for the system.</p>

<p>(the jury system, defend lawyer and district attorney PK, the judge is just a monitor, the jury make the decision)</p>

<p>Helen is a DA, wanna to put the bad men into jail, limited to the jury system, which is her tool too.</p>

<p>The Practice is the greatest legal drama, no other series in the same level with it.</p>

<h2 id="my-practice">My Practice</h2>
<p>The practice has eight season.
Seaon 8 is my first.</p>

<p>I got shocked and attracted as soon as the s8ep1. even though, at first the reason is alan shore (some guy from Boston Legal)</p>

<p>Maybe two or three years later, the season 1 ,2, 3 come out ,thanks for Douban KW Group.</p>

<p>Here is the problem.
After KW group has tranlated S1,S2,S3, they decided to stop their work.
The stop reason is heard that Season 4,5,6,7 is not as good as S1-3
However, I still wanna see them, so far</p>

<p>It’s difficult for me to see them totally without any subtitle.
So I got some english subtitle from shooter.cn
Generally, it is OK for me, but still a litter confusing when debating in the law room.
It’s too fast to follow it.</p>

<p>So I decide to do a chn &amp; eng mixed subtitle.</p>

<h2 id="mixed-subtitle">Mixed Subtitle</h2>
<p>1, Got the English subtitle</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>1
00:00:00,312 –&gt; 00:00:01,833
Previously on The Practice</p>

<p>2
00:00:01,959 –&gt; 00:00:03,488
Something wrong, Ellenor? </p>

<p>3
00:00:03,584 –&gt; 00:00:04,848
You came to kill me? </p>

<p>```</p>

<p>2, translate it to Chinese </p>

<p>```</p>

<p>1 
00:00:00,312 - &gt; 00:00:01,833 
以前的做法 </p>

<p>2 
00:00:01,959 - &gt; 00:00:03,488 
有什么问题，Ellenor？ </p>

<p>3 
00:00:03,584 - &gt; 00:00:04,848 
你来杀我吗？ </p>

<p>```</p>

<p>3, Merge it </p>

<p>the code is like this:</p>

<p>```py
#! /usr/bin/env python</p>

<p>import time
import sys
import exceptions
import string</p>

<p>def main(argv=sys.argv):
	englist_title_file = open(argv[1],”r”)
	chinese_title_file = open(argv[2],”r”)
	mixed_title_file = open(argv[3],”w”)
	sub_index = 1
	sub_content = {}
	while 1 :
		### index line
		line = englist_title_file.readline()</p>

<pre><code>	if not line or line=="" or line=="\r" or line=="\r\n":
		break

	if sub_index == string.atoi(line):
		### sub time line
		englist_title_file.readline()
		### english subtitle line
		sub_content[sub_index] = englist_title_file.readline()
		### blank line
		englist_title_file.readline()

		sub_index += 1	
sub_index_max = sub_index		
sub_index = 1	
while 1 :
	### index line
	line = chinese_title_file.readline()
	mixed_title_file.write(line)

	print "xxxxx=    "+line
	if not line or line=="" or line=="\r" or line=="\r\n":
		break

	if sub_index == string.atoi(line):
		### sub time line
		line = chinese_title_file.readline()
		mixed_title_file.write(line)
		### chinese subtitle line
		line = chinese_title_file.readline()
		mixed_title_file.write(line)
		### english subtitle line
		line = sub_content[sub_index]
		mixed_title_file.write(line)
		### blank line
		line = chinese_title_file.readline()
		mixed_title_file.write(line)

		sub_index += 1
	if sub_index &gt;= sub_index_max :
		break

englist_title_file.close()
chinese_title_file.close()
mixed_title_file.close()
</code></pre>

<p>if <strong>name</strong> == “<strong>main</strong>”:
	sys.exit(main())</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>4, The mixed subtitle is done</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>1 
00:00:00,312 - &gt; 00:00:01,833

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new phone <a href="http://www.meizu.com/products/mx2fun.html">MX2</a> goes into my life.</p>

<p>with a problem like before.</p>

<p>Facebook, twitter, Youtube are blocked by fucking GFW.</p>

<p>Here is a solution to kick that out of your way.</p>

<h2 id="root-your-phone">1, Root your phone</h2>

<p>MX2 have a pretty function, which give you easy way to root.</p>

<p>Just go into Account Menu, and click “you wanna root”, then reboot your phone.</p>

<p>After the phone restart, it’s rooted.</p>

<p>However, it has a bug that will give your alert “will you give the App root Authority” again and again,</p>

<p>unless you are dead or your phone.</p>

<h2 id="install-superuser">2, Install SuperUser</h2>

<p>It is used to get the right of root Authority Publishing from MX2 Flyme system, to solve the problem we referred above.</p>

<p>Better to download the App from Google Play, ( NOT From MX shop, Wandoujia ).</p>

<p>After installing, update the SuperUser in infomation Tab,</p>

<p>it will Make some configuration automatically.</p>

<h2 id="install-goagent">3, Install GoAgent</h2>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/goagent/">Goagent</a>, a open source sofeware, using Google App id’s function to give a tunnel to break GFW.  </p>

<p>Every day ,it can offer 1G per app id, and every Email account can have 10 appids.</p>

<p>Goagent’s design is very good, Language used is python, so you can ignore the system, whatever your PC is based on Windows, Linux, Mac, etc..</p>

<pre><code>apply an account on google appid
download the goagent
make some configuration and upload the server part
make some configuration and start the proxy.py.
then
it works in PC, but not in phone.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="install-gae-proxy">4, Install GAE-proxy</h2>

<p>Again better to download the App from Google Play, ( NOT From MX shop, Wandoujia ).</p>

<p>MX shop and other offical shop can give you the App, which https function have some bugs……</p>

<p>Facebook:</p>

<pre><code>Facebook will identify your ID and phone, by give some Friends' Photo and let you mark it.

Maybe it's suspicious by Facebook's spam checking program, because so many facebook id from same ip gived by Google. 
</code></pre>

<p>Facebook and Twitter can work on Spec App GAE mode, Youtube only works on ALL App GAE mode.</p>

<h2 id="everything-goes-fine">5, Everything goes fine</h2>

<p>That’s all.</p>

<p>Any Problem, you can Solve it by Google.</p>

    name</em>1=<code>echo $i | sed 's/.MOV//'</code>
    newname=<code>echo $name_1"_"$name_2".MOV"</code>
    cp $i output/$newname
